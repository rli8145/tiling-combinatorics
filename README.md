An computational companion to my [IB Mathematics AA HL Internal Assessment](MATHIA.pdf), which was written in my senior year of high school (the version attached is revised and slightly shortened). 

The paper is meant to be accessible to a broad audience, and this repo enhances understanding and verifies mathematical correctness by providing:
- C++ tiling enumerator (CLI)
- Python analysis scripts
- Interactive React visualization
